# Nuxt 3

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

_We are using Nuxt 3 and Quasar together this go's a bit against the build of the 2 frameworks. As they have both there own redenering and routing features. But we are using Quasar as a pure component library because it has an extensive component library and we are using Nuxt for server side rendering and for it's simple routing system._

### To keep in mind

We are using a proxy to talk to the backend. Because all external calls on the client side result in a cross origin error, this means the browser blocks these calls.
So all `/api/**` will point to the backend url. For local development this is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
See `pages/surveys` for an example of how to fetch the backend data.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

Let use Yarn instead of NPM for this project, it's a lot faster.
For installation, see: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.

## Linting

For the linting to work, install these plugins in your editor:
- [Vue.volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
- [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Libraries

- [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) a an component library. (Think of Bootstrap css but then with Vue component)
