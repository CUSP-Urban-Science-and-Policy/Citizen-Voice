            <p>Engaging and understanding communities affected by urban development leads to better planning decisions
                and improved social outcomes. As a tool for public participation, Citizen Voice opens a channel for
                citizens to voice their experiences, needs, and aspirations. Citizen Voice provides the opportunity for
                citizen involvement from the early phase to the follow-up phase of urban development projects.</p>
