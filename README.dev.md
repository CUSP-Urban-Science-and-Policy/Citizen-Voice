# Developer documentation

If you're looking for user documentation, go [here](README.md).

## Development installation

Follow the instruction below to set up a development environment. We use Python 3.10 and Django 4.0.x for development.

### Requirements

* [GDAL 3.3.2](https://gdal.org/download.html) or later
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/install/) extension

### Create a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the development dependencies in it. This will enable you to run the tests and web-apps later.
[For Windows read here.](https://medium.com/co-learning-lounge/create-virtual-environment-python-windows-2021-d947c3a3ca78)

```shell
# Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
python3 -m venv ./venv

# activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# (from the project root directory)
# install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Django App

1. Create a `.env` file with a secret key for the django project, and the database configuration, such as:
    
    ```shell
    # .env file in ./citizenvoice/
    SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-<a hexadecimal string>'
    POSTGRES_USER = '<username>'
    POSTGRES_DBASE = '<database-name>'
    POSTGRES_PWD = '<password>'
    POSTGRES_HOST = '<server-name/IP>'
    POSTGRES_PORT = '<port-number>'
    ```
2. Run the development server from the project directory. Saved changes will be authomatically reloaded:

    ```shell
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Running the tests

Running the tests requires an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed.

```shell
# unit tests
cd ./citizenvoice
python manage.py test
```

## Making a release

### Preparation

1. Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated
2. Verify that the information in `CITATION.cff` is correct, and that `.zenodo.json` contains equivalent data
3. Make sure that `version` in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) and  `version` in [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) have been bumped to the to-be-released version of the template
4. Run the unit tests with `python manage.py test`
5. Go through the steps outlined above for [generating a new package from the command line](#), and verify that the generated package works as it should.

### GitHub

1. Make sure that the GitHub-Zenodo integration is enabled for https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template
1. Go to https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template/releases and click `Draft a new release`

### The REST API and authentication

We are using Django rest knox for authentication. Knox authentication is token based, similar to the TokenAuthentication.
This means some API's are protected and can only be called with a authentication token. 
To get an valid authentication token you need to have an account and then login with that account.

Example using postman:
Create a new POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/` in the body add the next key value pairs in `from-data`:

| key      | value        |
| -------- | ------------ |
| email    | <your email> |
| password | <your pass>  |

As a response you will receive:
```json
{
    "expiry": "2023-01-24T11:00:24.545608Z",
    "token": "<token>",
    "user": {
        "id": <id>,
        "username": "<name>",
        "email": "<email></email>"
    }
}
```

Use the token string to fetch authenticated API's:
Create a new GET request in postman to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/me`. In the `Headers` add the key value pair:

| key           | value         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Authorization | Token <token> |

Make sure your using the same capitals and have a space between `Token` and `<token>`.

Now you should get the authenticated user data.
